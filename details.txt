. All you have to do is enter your card details, add the food or items you want to your basket, 
  and cabin crew will deliver your purchases directly to your seat.
  everything is better. From pre-flight drinks (in real glasses, obvs.), to meals served
. Full flat-bed seats are the general standard for business class
  it was so fast , it is possible to arrive at your destination at a local time that was earlier than when you left.
